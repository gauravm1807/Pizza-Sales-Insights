## Problem Statement

We need to analyze the pizza dataset provided by our client, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), uncover important insights, and translate them into clear visuals. This will help our client easily grasp the story within their data.

## Overview

The Pizza Sales Project involves analyzing and visualizing sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project employs SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI for data visualization. Its objective is to offer insights and actionable information, enabling the pizza restaurant chain to optimize operations, enhance sales, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Acquisition
The project begins with the acquisition of raw sales data. This data may include information such as customer orders, product details, order dates, and transaction amounts. Data can be obtained from various sources, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

### 2. Data Transformation with SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating new calculated fields.

### 3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:

- Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
- Analyzing sales trends over time.
- Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
- Calculating average order values.
- Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.

### 4. Power BI Visualization
Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:

- Bar charts and pie charts displaying sales by product category.
- Time series charts illustrating sales trends.
- Geographic maps showing the distribution of restaurant locations.
- Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
